Ahmedabad.csv (dataset)
DatasetExtract.py (Script)

We created a script to extract the dataset from an API. The API had day-wise rainfall and weather data of every city. We only extracted data of Ahmedabad city from the past 11 years (i.e, 2009-2020 ) by executing the created script. 
The extracted data contains an hourly forecast of parameters such as precipitation(MM), temperature, wind speed, pressure, visibility, etc.
